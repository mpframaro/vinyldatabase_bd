# Python Flask Application For SQL Vinyl Databse

This project was done for a second year curricular unit (Bases de Dados).

I first created a UML universe, along with its diagram and the respective relational model diagram.<br>
This universe is made of the following classes/relations:
- Colecionador
- Possui
- Projeto
- Interprete
- Musica

Using SQLite I created a database that holds all these classes and relations, and then populated it!<br>
I then developed a Flask application that allows for the visualization of all this information.
