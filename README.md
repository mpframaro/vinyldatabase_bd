# Python Flask Application For SQL Vinyl Databse

This project was done for a second year curricular unit (Bases de Dados).

Using Python, I implemented a series of search algorithms to better solve the 15 puzzle!
Further rules about the game can be read here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle

The search algorithms implemented were:

IDFS
BFS
DFS
GREEDY
A*
